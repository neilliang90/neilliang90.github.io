I obtained my Ph.D. degree in  [Computer Science](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/) from [University at Connecticut, UCONN](https://uconn.edu/) in May 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Jinbo Bi](https://jinbo-bi.uconn.edu/),  M.S. in Statistics from [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) and B.S. in Mathematics from [Zhengzhou University](http://english.zzu.edu.cn/). My research interests include Machine Learning, Mathematical Optimization, Statistics, Deep Learning, Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Recommender System.  My goal is to develop efficient and privacy-preserving optimization algorithms for machine learning, deep learning and federated learning.
